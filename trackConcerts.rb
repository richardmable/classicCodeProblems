# You are building an app to track concerts. You pull data into your app via an api, but the data is received as a line of text:
# e.g.
# Bob Dylan:Mann Music Center, 7/13/16 at 7:30PM (seperated by &)
# The list comes in at a random order. Your task is to build two functions (though more are modularity is encouraged) 
# that receive a list and either an artist or a venue to return all concerts related to that information.
